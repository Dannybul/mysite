<h1>Me in 20 seconds</h1>

<p>I'm a builder first and foremost. I love creating and improving things to be useful to others or to improve the world. That's why I love building software.</p>

<p>In my past I have built an online distribution company, wrote 2 patents, worked with a startup to build a new way of donating, but now I am focused on building websites and applications.</p>

<p>I'm looking to continue to build in roles like software engineering, web development, and app development.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>
<h4>NASA project</h4>
<a href = "https://dannybul.github.io/The-Nasa-Project/" target = "_blank"> Click to View </a>
<p>I had so much fun working with Nasa’s API to build a fully responsive and dynamic website. This website was made in a group project in a website development class at Loyola University Chicago. Personally, I did most of the work on the image of the day page and the search archive page.</p>
<p>The search archive page was exciting to work on because there were a lot of important components that needed to work together. Upon receiving user input and validating it, the website queried NASA’s api using asynchronous promises. Once the promise is fulfilled, JavaScript dynamically builds a grid structure with the images from the response; it is styled similar to Pinterest. When our users are scrolling through the images, they might like to learn more about an image. If a user clicks on one of the images, it will enlarge and display information like the title, date, and summary.</p>
<h4>Android development</h4>
I wanted to learn more about Android development, so I decided to take a Udemy class online. It was an extremely well taught class and during the course of it I created a variety of applications. I programmed apps that play music, quiz users, show the weather in your current location, track the price of bitcoin, and message other users. This was a time consuming class, but I learned so much about development through the course of it.
<h4>Bills</h4>
This project is my first independent React project. It is still in progress. I have created React applications throughout a Udemy course, but I wanted to go through the process alone. I feel like you learn the most this way. This project uses Propublica’s bill api. It displays upcoming bills and will easily allow people to contact their representatives. I’m hoping this encourages people to be more involved in our democracy.
<h3>Interests</h3>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>While I don’t believe that the programming language is as important as the problem solving ability of the programmer, familiarity makes the programmer faster initially. That being said, I have familiarity in many different programming languages.</p>

<p>My favorite programming language is Java. I believe it is a very straight forward and versatile language. It is probably my favorite because I have been using it consistently for years. The thing that really wows me about it is the documentation. It is unbelievably easy to find the method or class you are looking for.</p>

<p>Another language that I have a lot of familiarity with is JavaScript. It’s a very flexible language that can be used in a variety of environments. I have used a lot of vanilla JavaScript in building web applications. I have also been using React for a web application recently. I definitely see a great deal of benefits using this technology, but it does add some complexity.</p>

<p> I have worked with Python for a little bit. I'm by no means an expert, but I found it to be quite an easy language to pick up and use. I loved the financial technology packages, which I used a lot for one of my classes. You can do some pretty complex computations and graph them quite easily. I have also used it to create a betting aribtrage calculator. I use this in combination with a betting information api. If there is an opportunity on any of the betting sites, it will text me using Twilio's api.</p>

<h3>Favorite books</h3>
<p>Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is one of my favorite books because it changed my perspective completely in life. If the question “Why are humans so much more powerful than any other species” perplexes you, this is a great read. He does a terrific job of bringing you through the history of humanity. While I’m sure a lot of books do this, he is extraordinary in framing recent events in a historical context.</p>
<p>Zero to One by Peter Thiel is a very interesting book. Anyone who knows me knows that I frequently get excited by new ideas that could potentially change people's lives. I have read this book more than 5 times as a litmus test for my ideas. More than that, it shows the kind of companies that build the future. This helps one decide where they should spend their time. Like it or not, we live in the world where these companies have a lot of power, and it can be very helpful to be able to identify these companies early.</p>
<p>Outliers by Malcom Gladwell is a classic for the innovator type. It shows the components of becoming a highly successful outlier. Surprisingly, at least to me, was that a large component of success is the opportunity given to these people. Of course, there must be a business opportunity available to become successful in business, but you must also be given the opportunity to prepare for it. For example, Bill Gates was one of the few people of his generation to be given the opportunity to code the vast amount of hours that he did; this led to his success at Microsoft.</p>
